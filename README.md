# React Testing Talk

https://www.meetup.com/React-JAX/events/251275752/

This is where I'll prepare.  It will eventually become a companion repo to the
talk.


## Main Idea

I've got pages of notes on a yellow pad.  Good stuff!

> Tests don't have to be perfect, they only require a net value.


Testing is often presented in a perfect environment.  In reality, people
complain that it's not practical and end up dismissing testing altogether.
Trying to be _too_ academic can prevent you from useful testing and put off
others.

Perfect test environments don't exist in real life.

It's not about perfection.  It's about keeping the balance between cost and
benefit.  There are techniques for this that we will discuss.

**Costs**
* maintenance
* running time
* complexity

**Benefits**
* confidence
* TDD - better code structure
